Raw code from [Live Stream May 13 2019](https://youtu.be/mXDrH0wStHs?t=1568)

A neural network powered vehicle that drives around a randomly-generated path without hitting the walls.

Uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) libraries.

## To Do
- [ ] Smooth track with OpenSimplexNoise
- [ ] Improve the look of the track and cars
- [ ] Add paragraph elements displaying the simulation speed and best car stats
- [ ] Add functionality for saving/loading cars
- [ ] Add sliders to control the features of the track before it is generated, like 
  * difficulty
  * thickness
  * jaggedness
  * height of jaggedness
- [ ] Add button to regenerate track
- [ ] Add fov rendering
- [ ] Add crossover
- [ ] create cool tracks with the supershape formula
